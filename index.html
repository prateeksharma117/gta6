      <h2>Everything we know about Rockstar Games' GTA 6</h2>
      <img class="bodyimg1" src="..//images/gta61.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        GTA 6 news, leaks and rumours have slowed down considerably over the
        last few months. Now that it has officially been confirmed, many are
        wondering when we will see more information.All the signs suggest that
        we may see something by the end of the year, but we won't be making
        any major bets on that! Here's what we know about it so far.
      </p>

      <h2>LATEST - New GTA 6 Details Revealed by Rockstar Employees</h2>
      <img class="bodyimg1" src="..//images/gta62.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Senior Cinematics Camera Artist Nathan Hunt and Senior animator Ryan
        Schacter have both had their LinkedIn profiles examined very closely
        by fans of the GTA franchise lately as both men had listed "Grand
        Theft Auto 6" in the Experience section of their profiles, potentially
        revealing some information regarding the highly-anticipated game.
        <br />
        Hunt's profile listed GTA 6 next other titles he's worked on including
        Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead: Online and GTA Online before
        explaining what he does in his role. This has led to increased
        speculation around GTA 6 with some of the points, such as Hunt's
        involvement with "...Seamless transitions from cinematics to in-game."
        potentially implying the return of multiple playable protagonists.
        <br />
        Schacter's profile, meanwhile, gives us a much clearer understanding
        as to what could be coming in GTA 6 with a section dedicated to the
        work on the game specifically. Since this info began spreading around,
        however, it's worth mentioning that the two developers have scrubbed
        their profiles clean of any and all mentions of GTA 6 with Hunt making
        his account private to avoid any further leaks of information.
      <h2> GTA V Selling very well</h2>

      <p> In a report at Gamesindustry.biz, Take Two's EVP of Finance, Hannah Sage, said that GTA V's rerelease on Xbox
        Series X and PlayStation 5 "exceeded expectations".
        This is a sign of their reinvestment into the franchise. GTA 6 is clearly a priority right now.
        Most Liked Gaming Tweet of all time As pointed out by Dexerto, the RockStar Games' announcement of GTA 6 is
        officially the most liked gaming tweet of all time.
        As of the time of publishing, it has 599.4k Likes, 104.6K retweets and 40.6K Quote Tweets. These are some
        seriously impressive figures.</p>

      <h2> GTA+ Released </h2>
      <p>Following the release of GTA 5 on next gen, for which you can read in full review here, Rockstar has released
        GTA +.As Rockstar themselves put it, "GTA+ is a new membership program exclusively for GTA Online on PlayStation
        5 and
        Xbox Series X|S — launching on March 29 and providing easy access to a range of valuable benefits for both new
        and long-standing players on the latest generation consoles." You can see all the details of what signing up for
        it gets you here.
        It's likely that GTA + will be an important feature for GTA 6 once it releases.</p>

      <h2> Reveal due this fall? </h2>
      <p> Based on how Rockstar plans out their major releases, we're led to believe that the official reveal and first
        look
        at GTA 6 could come this fall.Even with a planned 2024 release date, the timelines still add up for how GTA 5
        was
        revealed and released with nearly 2 years between those dates.</p>

      <h2> Rockstar confirm GTA 6 development is "well underway"</h2>
      <p>After years of rumours and reports, Rockstar has confirmed that they are working on a new Grand Theft Auto
        game, stating that it's "well underway". This is the first time that the studio has acknowledged anything GTA 6
        related, so hopefully, we'll hear more news soon.

        Although Rockstar Games touched upon GTA 5's "unprecedented longevity" as well as what's to come for GTA in the
        future, the company didn't mention anything about a release date.

        It's tough to tell what the release window for GTA 6 will look like, especially with GTA V next-gen releasing on
        March 15, 2022 and GTA V going on nine years of existence. One thing's for certain, though, we're much closer to
        an official announcement now that Rockstar have revealed that the game is in progress.</p>

      <img class="bodyimg1" src="..//images/gta63.jpg" alt="">
      <p>One of the most reliable sources of GTA 6 rumors has been Tom Henderson. He mentioned that, like Fortnite, the
        upcoming game will have an evolving map that will be updated at regular intervals. However, some fans compared
        it to Red Dead Redemption 2 instead.

        They speculated that it could indicate a chronologically advancing plot that would start in the 80s. Henderson,
        however, reiterated that the game will take place in modern-day Vice City, with no possibility of featuring the
        80s or any other era. He also mentioned that there would be multiple protagonists and one of them could be
        female. Matheus Victor's leaks are also consistent with Henderson's. He stated that the game will start in
        Brazil in 2003 (prologue) and jump to Vice City in the present day, with a brother-sister protagonist duo. He
        also claimed to have heard some of the in-game radio music.

        It's worth noting that most leakers, including Henderson, believe the game will be released in 2023-2024, and a
        trailer will be released this year.</p>

      <h2>Even Rockstar is sick of hearing about GTA 6 now!</h2>
      <p>Rockstar has taken drastic action by muting the term GTA 6 on their youtube channel. Any comments left with the
        term included will not be posted.Prolific Rockstar content creator StrangeMan showed proof that the comments are
        no longer appearing.</p>
      <img class="bodyimg1" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_qi2neX0AgMduk?format=jpg&name=small" alt="">

      <h2>GTA 6 Should bring back Real Estate and Businesses</h2>
      <p>One feature from GTA: Vice City that was mostly loved was business and real estate management. It didn't play a
        huge role in the game but for those chasing 100% completion, it was a requirement. We would love to see this
        return in GTA 6 in a larger capacity, perhaps how it was handled in games like Saint's Row.</p>


      <h2>Fan storms live TV Show demanding GTA 6</h2>
      <p>In one of the strangest gaming stories ever, a fan stormed the set of a live German TV show demanding a GTA 6
        release date.The video can be found on this German Reddit page. The encounter is both bizarre and awkward.
        Fortunately, everything was handled calmly but it does seem like it takes an age for security to apprehend the
        intruder
        It appears the wait for GTA 6 is truly set to be a few years longer yet. Popular Bloomberg reporter Jason
        Schreier
        has backed up the rumoured 2025 release date from @_Tom_Henderson_ Both have stated that what they are hearing
        out
        of Rockstar Games matches up and a 2025 release date is the most likely scenario.He has mentioned how
        cryptocurrency could be used in GTA 6 in the past, but @_Tom_Henderson_ is back with some more GTA 6 leaks.

        In a new GTA 6 focused video, moving away from his normal Battlefield and Call of Duty focus, he talks about
        various things he's heard over the last few months. According to his sources, GTA 6 will not release until 2025,
        it will be set in a modern version of Vice City, and will feature an evolving map.

        Whether means parts of the map will be replaced every few months, like Fortnite and Warzone, it's not clear, but
        it could offer various ways of expanding GTA Online.</p>

      <h2>Release Date</h2>
      <p>So far there has been no official release date given.But, with GTA V launching back in 2013 it is very safe to
        say that GTA 6 is in development.</p>

      <h2>Platforms</h2>
      <p>With a potential 2023 release window, we will be right in the middle of the next generation lifecycle, meaning
        that it, is extremely unlikely we will see the game release on either the PS4 or Xbox One.Instead, it will
        release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.GTA V didn't release on PC for two years after the console release,
        but with the popularity of the PC version of GTA V, it is likely we will see a launch of GTA 6 on PC from day 1,
        or at least fairly close to it.
